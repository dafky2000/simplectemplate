# How to contribute
First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project. We're trying to make a stable project and try to fix bugs and add new features continuously. You can help us do more.

## Getting started

### Check out the "Issues"

We have some missing details and problems listed there. If there is a bug or a feature that is not listed in the **issues** page or there is no one assigned to the issue, feel free to fix/add it! Although it's better to discuss it in the issue or create a new issue for it so there is no confilcting code.

### Writing some code!

Contributing to a project on Github is pretty straight forward. If this is you're first time, these are the steps you should take.

1. Fork this repo.
2. Commit the changes
3. Push to the branch

And that's it! Read the code available and change the part you don't like! Your change should not break the existing code and should pass the tests.

If you're adding a new functionality, start from the branch **master**. It would be a better practice to create a new branch and work in there.

When you're done, submit a pull request and for one of the maintainers to check it out. We would let you know if there is any problem or any changes that should be considered.

### Documentation

Every chunk of code that may be hard to understand has some comments above it. If you write some new code or change some part of the existing code in a way that it would not be functional without changing it's usages, it needs to be documented.
