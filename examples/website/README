simplecgen uses the simplectemplate
<https://github.com/dafky2000/simplectemplate> library to generate a
web site.

The template library is included (If you like this project, please
remember to also star the simplectemplate library repository).

To build simplecgen:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../src
    make

simplecgen will look for the config file (simplecgen.conf) in the
directory from which you are running simplecgen.

To generate the sample site:

    From the top level directory

        ./build/simplecgen (it will read ./templates and ./infiles for the data)

You can then preview the site by opening index.html in your web browser.

Some of the web site design was done by Elliot Alexander
